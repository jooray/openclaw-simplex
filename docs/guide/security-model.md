# Security Model

This plugin enforces channel-side controls before handing requests to the agent.

## Access controls

- `dmPolicy`: controls DM behavior (`open`, `allowlist`, `pairing`, `disabled`).
- `allowFrom`: explicit sender allowlist.
- `groupPolicy`: group behavior (`open`, `allowlist`, `disabled`).
- `groupAllowFrom`: group sender allowlist.
- Pairing support: explicit approval flow for unknown senders.

## Operational boundaries

- In `managed` mode, OpenClaw controls the SimpleX CLI process.
- In `external` mode, OpenClaw only gets WS access to an already-running endpoint.
- You decide where each process runs and what network path is allowed.

## Recommended production posture

- Start with `dmPolicy: "pairing"` and `groupPolicy: "allowlist"`.
- Keep `allowFrom`/`groupAllowFrom` narrow.
- Prefer `external` mode where process isolation is a strict requirement.
- Monitor status snapshots and logs for repeated authorization failures.
