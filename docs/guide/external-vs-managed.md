# External vs Managed

## Managed mode

OpenClaw starts and supervises `simplex-chat`.

Use when:

- You want single-process orchestration from OpenClaw.
- You prefer fewer moving parts in deployment.

Example:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "simplex": {
      "connection": {
        "mode": "managed",
        "cliPath": "simplex-chat",
        "wsHost": "127.0.0.1",
        "wsPort": 5225
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## External mode

You operate SimpleX WS separately and OpenClaw only connects.

Use when:

- You need stronger process isolation.
- You already run SimpleX as a separate service.

Example:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "simplex": {
      "connection": {
        "mode": "external",
        "wsUrl": "ws://127.0.0.1:5225"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Decision rule

- Choose `managed` for fastest setup.
- Choose `external` for stricter operational isolation and explicit lifecycle control.
